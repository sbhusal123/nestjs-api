# Provider

[Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers)

- Fundamental concept in nestjs.

- Many nestjs classes treated as a providers-services, repositories, factories, helpers, ...

***Main idea of having provider is it can be injected as a dependency. this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system. ***


> Boilerplate

```js

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
}
```

Services must be registered to prviders array of the module as

```js
@modules({
    providers: [CatsService]
})
class MyModule() {}
```
