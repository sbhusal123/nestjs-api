# Provider

[Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers)

- Fundamental concept in nestjs.

- Many nestjs classes treated as a providers-services, repositories, factories, helpers, ...

***Main idea of having provider is it can be injected as a dependency. this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system.***


> Boilerplate

```js

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {

    greet(){
        return {
            "message": "Hello world."
        }
    }
}
```

Services must be registered to prviders array of the module as

Note that provider are always decorated with ``@Injectable()`` decorator.

```js
@modules({
    providers: [CatsService]
})
class MyModule() {}
```

Using service on  a controller:

```js
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import CatsService from 'cats.service.md'

@Controller("foo")
export class MyController {
    constructor(private catsService: CatsService){}

    @Get("bar")
    bar(){
        return this.catsService.greet()
    }
}

```

- ``nest g provider <module>`` generates provider for ``<module>``.
